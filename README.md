**Customer Churn Prediction Model**
Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customer churn. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers by understanding and mitigating factors leading to attrition. This notebook demonstrates a step-by-step approach to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using machine learning technique.
